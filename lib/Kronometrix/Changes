Revision history for Perl extension Kronometrix.

0.17 2017-07-02
    - Removed the -s switch in async mode both in webrec and in
      svcrec.
0.16 2017-06-14
    - Changed sleep function to Time::HiRes in Webrec::Queue
      so that the -s switch works as intended. Fixed the default
      to 0.1 seconds. 

0.15 2017-06-07
    - Moved svcrec2 to svcrec and svcrec to svcrec.orig
    - Added switch -s to webrec and svcrec
    
0.14 2017-06-05
    - Added routine to log warnings in Kronometrix.pm
    - Modified Kronometrix::Svcrec to preserve ordering in async mode.

0.13 2017-05-31
    - Closed Net::Ping connections and moved the Net::Ping object
      to a lexical variable. Changed from sprintf to printf in the
      reporting routine to remove one function call. Running time
      is now closer to that of the original svcrec.

0.12 2017-05-28
    - Moved the creation of the Net::Ping object to the
      inside of the main cycle in order to make the running
      time comparable to the original svcrec.
