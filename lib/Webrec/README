Kronometrix-Webrec-Queue version 1.1.2
======================================

This distribution implements a system of queues of URL requests.
The goal is to measure the time it takes to complete each request.
For each request, the following information is reported:

  01 timestamp : seconds since Epoch, time
  02 request   : the HTTP request name
  03 ttime     : total time the entire operation lasted, seconds
  04 ctime     : connect time it took from the start until the TCP 
                 connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed, 
                 seconds
  05 dnstime   : namelookup time, it took from the start until the name 
                 resolving was completed, seconds
  06 ptime     : protocol time, it took from the start until the file 
                 transfer was just about to begin, seconds
  07 pktime    : first packet time, it took from the start until the 
                 first byte was just about to be transferred, seconds
  08 size      : page size, the total amount of bytes that were 
                 downloaded
  09 status    : response status code, the numerical response code 
                 that was found in the last retrieved HTTP(S) transfer

The system may send requests either sequentially or concurrently.
It can also be configured to make a delay between requests to the
same host and to limit the number of concurrent requests to the same
host.

The system works by building one queue per host. There is a per-host
request index to keep track of the requests which have been sent, and
there is a hash of hosts that keeps track of the times at which host
connections shall be freed to receive a new request, thus implementing
delays between requests to the same host.

Please do:

webrec --help
